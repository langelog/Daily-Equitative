What is this project?\r\n\r\nWell, this project is an android application programmed in c++ (this is just because I'm more comfortable with this language than java, no other reason) that allows you to keep in track the movements that you're doing with your daily expenses (duuhh), really simple, no deep $#!t. Now the application tells you that today you have a quota of expenses according to the number of days that the next payment will arrive. So if you spend too much today, tomorrow your quota will be lower that today, but if you spend less than the quota, then you will have a higher quota tomorrow.\r\n\r\n## What's the current status?\r\n\r\nCurrently it's working but without status saving. Also, currently it's really ugly, but the style $#!t will become later.\r\n\r\n## Doesn't this already exist?\r\n\r\nMaybe, I'm just publishing my coding on free days :)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
